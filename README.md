# pongProjectY1
First year at University of York we had a project where we created our own Pong game for a Raspberry Pi. This is the software my team and I developed. 

We had to make the controllers and interfact with them through the Rasberry Pi. We alo has to project the game through a seperate screen that only supported ASCII. 

This was a super fun project where I learnt a lot about both software developement in a team but also hardware restrictions and how to be creative to work around them.
